# Document Approval

A simple, audit-ready document approval system built with **.NET 10** using **Clean Architecture**.

The domain models a document that must be approved by one or more users in a strict sequence.  
Business rules are enforced inside the domain to ensure correctness regardless of API or UI usage.

This repository contains:
- A Clean Architecture .NET API
- Domain-enforced approval invariants
- Automated tests
- A thin React demo UI (added later)

More details will be added as the project evolves.
